* rust-callgraph

Computes the callgraph of rust programs.

Works with Rustc nightly 1.82.0 (`nightly-2024-08-07`). Works with full Cargo projects.

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export RUSTFLAGS="-L $RUSTUP_HOME/toolchains/nightly-2024-08-07-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$RUSTUP_HOME/toolchains/nightly-2024-08-07-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib"
cargo install --debug --locked --path . --force
#+END_SRC

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ./example_code
cargo callgraph # To run on a full Cargo project
callgraph src/fun_method.rs # To run on a single file
#+END_SRC

* How it works

Using the rustc interface, run the compiler until after analysis stage, walk the expanded syntax tree and remember function and method definitions and resolved calls.

* Features
Extracts all kinds of calls:
- function defs
- struct associated impl methods
- trait method declarations
- trait method default impl
- trait method implementations
- statically dispatched calls
- dynamically dispatched calls

Missing features:
- requires a nightly toolchain (this will not change since the rustc interface will not be stabilized)
- rudimentary debugging output, no real output
