* rust-callgraph

Computes the callgraph of rust programs.

Forked from [[https://github.com/heinzelotto/rust-callgraph]], updated to be compilable with Rustc 1.78.0.

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo +nightly r -- example_code/fun_method.rs --sysroot /usr/local/
#+END_SRC

Adapt the path of the sysroot, e. g. ~/home/felix/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/~.

The arguments are passed to a call to rustc.

* How it works

Using the rustc interface, run the compiler until after analysis stage, walk the expanded syntax tree and remember function and method definitions and resolved calls.

* Features
Extracts all kinds of calls:
- function defs
- struct associated impl methods
- trait method declarations
- trait method default impl
- trait method implementations
- statically dispatched calls
- dynamically dispatched calls

Missing features:
- requires a nightly toolchain (this will not change since the rustc interface will not be stabilized)
- runs a single rustc commandline, no support to build a whole cargo project
- rudimentary debugging output, no real output
